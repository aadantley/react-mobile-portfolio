# Meditation App

based on this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UKCv9T_rIo>

## Notes

### Setup

we run this with `npm install` and then `npm start`.

Clear out boilerplate components and tabs and just start from an empty `app` folder, with an `index.jsx` file.

Expo router provides file-based router, which is great for making this project like a next.js project.

### Assets

grab asset files from google drive link.
